  description: |
    This layer shows the Limit of Moderate Wave Action, or LiMWA.
    
    The LiMWA identifies areas that will be affected by waves with a 1.5 foot wave height
    or greater within the coastal A zone.
    
    While FEMA does not require special floodplain management standards based on LiMWA delineations,
    it is likely that properties and structures within the LiMWA will receive substantial damage
    from wave action during a 1%-annual-chance flood event.
