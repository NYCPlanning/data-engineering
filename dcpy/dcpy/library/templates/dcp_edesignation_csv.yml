      ### NYC (E) Designations
      (E) Designations are established to provide notice of the presence of an environmental
      requirement pertaining to potential hazardous materials contamination, high ambient noise
      levels or air emission concerns on a particular tax lot. This includes CEQR Environment
      Requirements and CEQR Restrictive Declarations, in Appendix C of the
      Zoning Resolution.

      Not all columns are currently included in shapefile, hence why we need this table.
      This should be fixed sometime before 2024 Q3, and at that point this template can be archived
