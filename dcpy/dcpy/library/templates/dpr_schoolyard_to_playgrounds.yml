      The Schoolyards to Playgrounds initiative began with PlaNYC 2007 as a way to expand public use 
      at existing City facilities and improve access to open spaces during non-school hours which includes 
      weekends, holidays, and during the summer. 

      NYC Parks, in collaboration with the Department of Education (DOE) and the nonprofit Trust for Public Land 
      have improved hundreds of DOE operated schoolyards through capital improvements, including play equipment, 
      painted sports surfaces, trees, and benches.

      The program is an important approach to reaching the cityâ€™s target to getting more New Yorkers within 
      walking distance to open-space. In many neighborhoods, these DOE schoolyards are one of the few resources that 
      can be improved and provide publicly accessible open space.

      Each record in this dataset represents a participating DOE Schoolyard at the time of the dataset's publication. 
      The schoolyard's boundaries have been drawn in whole or part using secondary data. Data accuracy is limited by 
      the scale and accuracy of the original sources. Site-specific conditions should be field-verified.

      This dataset may be updated throughout the year as school's join or exit the program.
