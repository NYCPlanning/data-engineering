  name: Food Scrap Drop-Off Locations in NYC
  description: >-
    Locations where NYC residents can drop off their food scraps to be composted. Please
    note that starting on March 20, 2020, DSNY suspended some services to limit
    person-to-person contact and to enable our workforce to refocus on core operations.
    Suspended services include Food Scrap Drop-off sites which will be closed until
    further notice. Residents should not leave food scraps at any location. Visit
    https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/nyc-food-scrap-drop-off-locations
    for updates.
