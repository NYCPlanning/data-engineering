# City Owned and Leased Properties Database

Various city authorities own or lease a large inventory of properties. This repo contains code to create a database of all city owned and leased properties, as required under Section 204 of the City Charter. The database contains information about each property's use, owning/leasing agency, location, and tenent agreements. This repo is a refactoring of the dataset found on [Bytes of the Big Apple](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/about/publications/colp.page), and is currently in development.

The input data for COLP is the Integrated Property Information System (IPIS), a real estate database maintained by the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS).
