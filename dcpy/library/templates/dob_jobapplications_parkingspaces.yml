      This dataset is a one-time export from DOB containing historical BIS applications data with parking spots included
      There are three additional columns: "J_ENCLOSED_NUM_SPACES", "J_EX_PARKING_SPACES", and "J_PR_PARKING_SPACES" 

      Given that we get other columns from BIS open data, this is filtered in preprocessing to just jobnumber and parking space columns
