  description: >-
    This dataset contains a list of all inspections conducted and any associated
    violations at active, city-regulated, center-based child care programs and summer
    camps over the past 3 years. The violations are pre-adjudicated. Violations that are
    subject to potential penalties (fines) are submitted to NYC Office of Administrative
    Trials and Hearing where they are adjudicated as either sustained/upheld or
    dismissed. The dataset also contains additional information on the programs,
    including license information. For more information on child care in NYC visit:
