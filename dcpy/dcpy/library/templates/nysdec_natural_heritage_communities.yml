      ## DEC Natural Heritage Communities
      Features represent element occurrences of significant natural communities (ecological communities), 
      as recorded in the New York Natural Heritage Program's Biodiversity Database (Biotics). 
      An element occurrence is one natural community type at one location. 
      Examples of community types include deep emergent marsh, red maple-hardwood swamp, 
      dwarf shrub bog, hemlock-northern hardwood forest, and tidal creek
