  name: DOB NOW Certificate Of Occupancy
  description: >-
    This data set includes certificates of occupancy issued through the New York City
    Department of Buildings' DOB NOW: Certificate of Occupancy module. This module was
    released in March of 2021, anbd from that point onward this data set should be
    utilized instead of the "DOB Certificate of Occupancy" data set. The data is
    collected because the Department of Buildings tracks Certificates of Occupancies
    issued. This data include items such as job filing name, job filing label, BIN,
    Address, and Certificate of Occupancy status, sequence, label, and issuance date.

    "A Certificate of Occupancy (CO) states a legal use and/or type of permitted
    occupancy of a building. New buildings must have a CO, and existing buildings must
    have a current or amended CO when there is a change in use, egress or type of
    occupancy. No one may legally occupy a building until the Department has issued a CO
    or Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO).

    A CO confirms that the completed work complies with all applicable laws, all
    paperwork has been completed, all fees owed to the Department have been paid, all
    relevant violations have been resolved, and all necessary approvals have been
    received from other City Agencies. The Department issues a final CO when the
    completed work matches the submitted plans for new buildings or major alterations."
