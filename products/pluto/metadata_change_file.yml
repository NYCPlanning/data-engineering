  This is a companion dataset to PLUTO and MapPLUTO. PLUTO and MapPLUTO are
  created using the best available data from a number of city agencies. To further
  improve data quality, the Department of City Planning (DCP) applies changes to
  selected field values. DCPEdited is set to "1" in PLUTO if the record
  contains any changed values.
