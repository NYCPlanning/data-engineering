  description: |
    New York City Department of Transportation (NYC DOT) uses Automated Traffic 
    Recorders (ATR) to collect traffic sample volume counts at bridge crossings and 
    roadways. These counts do not cover the entire year, and the number of days counted 
    per location may vary from year to year.
