# Data Engineering Team

This is the primary repository for NYC DCP's Data Engineering team and is used to build data products. Our primary data products each have their own top-level folder here where their respective READMEs can be found.

The [Data Engineering wiki page](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/data-engineering/wiki) is the single source of truth for all of our documentation.
