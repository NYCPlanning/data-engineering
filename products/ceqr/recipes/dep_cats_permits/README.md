### **Description**
This dataset contains light industrial process permits registered with NYC DEP from the Clean Air Tracking System Data. Each row in the Excel spreadsheet contains a record of a light industrial process permit (permit records with P prefix) while the Shapefile provides a format that allows the user to import the data into mapping software. This information can be used to identify manufacturing or processing facilities within a 400 feet radius from the project site, as part of the preliminary stationary source screening analysis. If there are manufacturing or processing facilities within the 400 feet radius, further stationary source analysis may be needed to determine the effects of the sources on the project, requiring more detailed permit information.
