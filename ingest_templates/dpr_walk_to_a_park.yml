  description: |
    This dataset builds on the Walk to A Park Service Area (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Walk-to-a-Park-Service-area/5vb5-y6cv) to provide a dataset that can be viewed as an on-line map or downloaded to support the preparation of an Open Space assessment pursuant to City Environment Quality Review Technical Manual.
    
    The data has been modified to ensure that if 50% or more of a tax lot is within a Walk to a Park Service area, then the entire lot is shown as served.
