DESCRIPTION:
    Merging devdb with hny. This requires the following procedure.
    Following _hny.sql query with HNY_matches were completed

    5) Assign flags to indicate one_hny_to_many_dev and/or one_dev_to_many_hny.
        a) handle one devdb to many hny records cases by concatenating those hny_ids and combines units/fields 
        to create a single record
        b) Rest of the cases (one hny to many devdb, many hny to many devdb) are handled by including every 
        possible joins with devdb records for each hny recor.

    6) Combine the two tables to create HNY_devdb_lookup
