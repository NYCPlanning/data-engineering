## Development:
### Configurations
- We strongly advise that you use VScode for development of this project
- The `.devcontainer` contains all development configuration you would need, including:
    - `psql` is preinstalled
    - `python-geosupport` is installed with 21a geosupport
    - `poetry` is installed and initialized
    - `pre-commit` is also preconfigured and no additional setup is needed
- If you do not have vscode setup, don't worry, you can still develop using docker-compose
    - initialize docker-compose: `./facdb.sh init`
    - the facdb.sh script is a one to one wrapper of the python facdb cli, e.g. `./facdb.sh --help`
    - docker-compose is also used to test PR and build the dataset in github actions

### Pipeline development with the `facdb` cli
>ðŸ’¡ Note: the cli documentation might not always be up-to-date, to see the latest commands and features, use `facdb --help`

- Create a pipeline function under the name of the function, e.g. `dcp_colp`
- If you don't want to run every command with `poetry run`, we recommend you activate the virtual environment by `poetry shell`
- `facdb --help` to show instructions
```console
foo@bar:~$ facdb --help

<details><summary>Examples</summary>
    
- `facdb init` initialization of the database with `facdb_base`, functions and stored procedures
- `facdb dataloading` load supplementry datasets from data-library (e.g. `dcp_mappluto_wi`, `doitt_buildingcentroids`)
- `facdb run`
    - `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions` to execute both the python and sql part specified in `datasets.yml`
    - `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions --python` to execute the python part only
    - `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions --sql` to execute the sql part only
    - `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions --python --sql` is the same as `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions`
    - `facdb run --all` to run all available data piplines defined in `datasets.yml`
- `facdb sql`
    - `facdb sql -f facdb/sql/dcp_colp.sql` to execute one script
    - `facdb sql -f facdb/sql/dcp_colp.sql -f some/other/script.sql` to execute multiple scripts
- `facdb clear`
    - `facdb clear -n nysed_activeinstitutions` to clear cache for nysed_activeinstitutions
    - `facdb clear --all` to clear all cache for all datasets
- `facdb build` build facdb from loaded source tables and produce QAQC tables
