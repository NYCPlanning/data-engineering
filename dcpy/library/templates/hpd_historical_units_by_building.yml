      ### Historical Units by Project
      The Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) reports on buildings, units, 
      and projects that began after January 1, 2014 and are counted towards the Housing New York plan. 
      The Historical Units by Project file presents the pre-2014 data by project, and includes project-level data, 
      such as senior units, but does not include building-level data. 
      The unit counts are provided for each project, rather than by building.
