    The Schoolyards to Playgrounds initiative began with PlaNYC 2007 as 
    a way to expand public use at existing City facilities and improve access 
    to open spaces during non-school hours which includes weekends, holidays, 
    and during the summer.

    NYC Parks, in collaboration with the Department of Education (DOE) and the nonprofit 
    Trust for Public Land \nhave improved hundreds of DOE operated schoolyards through 
    capital improvements, including play equipment, painted sports surfaces, trees, and 
    benches.

    The program is an important approach to reaching the cityâ€™s target to getting more New 
    Yorkers within walking distance to open-space. In many neighborhoods, these DOE 
    schoolyards are one of the few resources that can be improved and provide publicly
    accessible open space.

    Each record in this dataset represents a participating DOE Schoolyard at the time of the 
    dataset's publication. The schoolyard's boundaries have been drawn in whole or part 
    using secondary data. Data accuracy is limited by the scale and accuracy of the original 
    sources. Site-specific conditions should be field-verified.

    This dataset may be updated throughout the year as school's join or exit the program.
