# FacDB Source Data Updates

Like most of our data products, source data must be updated in data library before FacDB is run. As there are are many source datasets with varied update processes, this issue template should be opened to track progress towards updating all source data

**All source data listed is to be uploaded as .csv files**

## Scraped by data library

- [ ] bpl_libraries
      Source: Scraped from BPL website

To see if a dataset needs to be uploaded, check date last updated in open data/bytes against version in data library.

      NOTE: `providertype` column has two types of meal categories. One of them, **CITY MEALS ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES CONTRACTS**, should only have one record (city meals). If there are more records in this category, need to revise code in `dfta_contracts.sql`.

## Manually check data for updates

The source datasets don't currently provide an API or export option on their websites. The data engineering team initially created the datasets and continues to maintain them internally, relying on the information available on the websites. Also, the source data websites don't report date updated as neatly as the open datasets, have to look at data itself.
