  description: >-
    This dataset lists active child care programs regulated under NYC Health Code Article 47 (Group Day Care)
    and Article 43 (School-based Child Care).

    These data can be used to map NYC Health Code regulated child care programs and filter by attributes,
    such as location, ages served, facility type. It can also be used to answer questions such as how many
    group child care (GCC) programs are in a specific ZIP code.

    Only active group child care (GCC) and school-based child care (SBCC) programs are displayed in this
    dataset. Child care programs with a 'preliminary', 'suspended', or 'closed' status are not included.
