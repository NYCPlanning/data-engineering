  name: Leaf Drop-Off Locations in NYC
  description: >-
    Locations where NYC residents can drop off their leaves to be composted. For more
    information, see:
    https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/community-leaf-drop-off.
    Please note that effective April 2, 2020, community gardens on NYC Parks property
    may remain open or closed to garden members only at the discretion of each garden
    group, and only for necessary maintenance and season preparation. Due to the
    relatively small spaces in most gardens and the difficulty in achieving safe social
    distancing of 6 feet or more, gardens must remain closed to the general public. For
    more info, see: https://greenthumb.nycgovparks.org/news.html?news_id=468
