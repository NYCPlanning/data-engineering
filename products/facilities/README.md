## QAQC:

[Streamlit QAQC Page](https://de-qaqc.nycplanningdigital.com/?page=Facilities+DB)

## Development:

### Configurations

- We strongly advise that you use VScode for development of this project
- The `.devcontainer` contains all development configuration you would need, including:
  - `psql` is preinstalled
  - `python-geosupport` is installed with 21a geosupport
  - `poetry` is installed and initialized
  - `pre-commit` is also preconfigured and no additional setup is needed
- If you do not have vscode setup, don't worry, you can still develop using docker-compose
  - initialize docker-compose: `./facdb.sh init`
  - the facdb.sh script is a one to one wrapper of the python facdb cli, e.g. `./facdb.sh --help`
  - docker-compose is also used to test PR and build the dataset in github actions

### Pipeline development with the `facdb` cli

> ðŸ’¡ Note: the cli documentation might not always be up-to-date, to see the latest commands and features, use `facdb --help`

- Create a pipeline function under the name of the function, e.g. `dcp_colp`
- If you don't want to run every command with `poetry run`, we recommend you activate the virtual environment by `poetry shell`
- `facdb --help` to show instructions

```console
foo@bar:~$ facdb --help
Usage: facdb [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  build        Building facdb based on facdb_base
  clear        clear will clear the cached dataset created while reading a...
  dataloading  Load SQL dump datasets from data library e.g.

  sql          this command will execute any given sql script against the...
```

<details><summary>Examples</summary>

- `facdb init` initialization of the database with `facdb_base`, functions and stored procedures
- `facdb dataloading` load supplementry datasets from data-library (e.g. `dcp_mappluto_wi`, `doitt_buildingcentroids`)
- `facdb run`
  - `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions` to execute both the python and sql part specified in `datasets.yml`
  - `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions --python` to execute the python part only
  - `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions --sql` to execute the sql part only
  - `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions --python --sql` is the same as `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions`
  - `facdb run --all` to run all available data piplines defined in `datasets.yml`
- `facdb sql`
  - `facdb sql -f facdb/sql/dcp_colp.sql` to execute one script
  - `facdb sql -f facdb/sql/dcp_colp.sql -f some/other/script.sql` to execute multiple scripts
- `facdb clear`
  - `facdb clear -n nysed_activeinstitutions` to clear cache for nysed_activeinstitutions
  - `facdb clear --all` to clear all cache for all datasets
- `facdb build` build facdb from loaded source tables and produce QAQC tables

</details>

# FacDB Source Data Updates

Like most of our data products, source data must be updated in data library before FacDB is run. As there are are many source datasets with varied update processes, this issue template should be opened to track progress towards updating all source data

**All source data listed is to be uploaded as .csv files**

## Geosupport

- [ ] Ensure latest Geosupport version is present in production EDM Docker images

## Version Env

- [ ] Update previous version for QCQA in `version.env` file

## Source data from OpenData

To see if a dataset needs to be uploaded, check date last updated in open data/bytes against version in data library.

## Manually check data for updates

The source datasets don't currently provide an API or export option on their websites. The data engineering team initially created the datasets 
and continues to maintain them internally, relying on the information available on the websites. Also, the source data websites don't report 
date updated as neatly as the open datasets, have to look at data itself. 

- [ ] fbop_corrections https://www.bop.gov/locations/list.jsp
  When searching by state, there should be 5 NY prisons, 3 of which are in NYC (Brooklyn/New York)

## Manual download

Manually download the following datasets to your local machine and make tweaks if needed per individual instructions. After downloading, 
use data library CLI to archive the data to S3. Refer to the dataset templates in data library to see where it expects the data â€“ that's where 
it will search when archiving. 
Sample CLI command ran locally to archive the `foodbankny_foodbanks` dataset to S3:
```bash 
library archive --s3 --name foodbankny_foodbanks --latest --version 20240108 --output-format csv
```

- [ ] foodbankny_foodbanks http://www.foodbanknyc.org/get-help/
  1. head to http://www.foodbanknyc.org/get-help/
  2. navigate to the map and make a copy of the map. The map can be found in the "Find Food Near You" drop-down menu. Note, you need to be logged in with a google account in order to have an option to copy the map.
  3. After making a copy, click on the three dots next to the target layer and click "Export Data" and export as a csv
  4. Rename the file (still as a csv) to match Food_Bank_For_NYC_Open_Members_as_of_DATE(YYYYMMDD). You will need to convert the existing date format MMDDYY to YYYYMMDD so that the version matches existing date format standard in data library. Example: Food_Bank_For_NYC_Open_Members_as_of_20240108.csv
  5. place it at the library/tmp folder
  6. then run library archive --name foodbankny_foodbanks with the -version flag set to the DATE in the file path
