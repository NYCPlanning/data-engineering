      ### NYC Zoning Map Index
      The NYC Zoning Map index is used to determine which zoning map is related to a specific geographic
      area in New York City. Zoning maps show the boundaries of zoning districts throughout the city.
      This data is available as shapefiles or a file geodatabase and contains two features,
      sections and quartersections.
