# FacDB Source Data Updates
Like most of our data products, source data must be updated in data library before FacDB is run. As there are are many source datasets with varied update processes, this issue template should be opened to track progress towards updating all source data

**All source data listed is to be uploaded as .csv files**

## Version Env

## Manually check data for updates
These don't report date updated as neatly as the open datasets, have to look at data itself

- [ ] fbop_corrections https://www.bop.gov/locations/list.jsp
When searching by state, there should be 5 NY prisons, 3 of which are in NYC (Brooklyn/New York)

- [ ] nycourts_courts http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/criminal/generalinfo.shtml#BRONX_COUNTY

- [ ] nysdoccs_corrections https://doccs.ny.gov/find-facility
Hand check for 1 facility in queens, 1 facility in Manhattan, 0 in the other 3 boros. Only look at the correctional facility locations, not the offices.

- [ ] foodbankny_foodbanks http://www.foodbanknyc.org/get-help/
      1. head to http://www.foodbanknyc.org/get-help/
      2. navigate to the map and make a copy of the map
      3. After making a copy, click on the three dots next to the target layer and click "Export Data" and export as a csv
      4. Rename the file (still as a csv) to match Food_Bank_For_NYC_Open_Members_as_of_DATE(YYYYMMDD). You will need to convert the existing date format MMDDYY to YYYYMMDD so that the version matches existing date format standard in data library.
      5. place it at the library/tmp folder
      6. then run library archive --name foodbankny_foodbanks with the -version flag set to the DATE in the file path
    url: "http://www.foodbanknyc.org/get-help/"
    dependents: []

      5. place it at the library/tmp folder
