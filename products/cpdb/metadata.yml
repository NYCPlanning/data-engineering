description: >
  Spatial data at the polygon level can be joined to the tabular Capital
  Projects dataset using the FSM ID. A majority of the spatial data was made available
  on NYC Open Data by agency partners. Some geometries were created manually, while
  others relied on 'Fuzzy String Matching'. This process relied on a join to DCP's
  Facilities Database and DPR's Parks Properties to match project descriptions to
  physical locations.
