    This particular version of this dataset has come from OMB. We haven't fully assessed whether
    we could just pull from the linked feature service instead and filter to NYC or if OMB has
    done any other preprocessing.

    This service identifies U.S. Census Block Groups in which 51% or more of the households earn 
    less than 80 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI). The Community Development Block Grant 
    (CDBG) program requires that each CDBG funded activity must either principally benefit low- 
    and moderate-income persons, aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or meet 
    a community development need having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a 
    serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community and other financial 
    resources are not available to meet that need. With respect to activities that principally 
    benefit low- and moderate-income persons, at least 51 percent of the activity's beneficiaries 
    must be low and moderate income.

    to activities that principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons, at least 51 percent 
    of the activity's beneficiaries must be low and moderate income. For CDBG, a person is considered 
    to be of low income only if he or she is a member of a household whose income would qualify as 
    "very low income" under the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments program. Generally, these 
    Section 8 limits are based on 50% of area median. Similarly, CDBG moderate income relies on 
    Section 8 "lower income" limits, which are generally tied to 80% of area median. These data 
    are from the 2011-2015 American Community Survey (ACS).
