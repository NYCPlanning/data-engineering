  description:
    The Pseudo Lots dataset contains polygons of locations that have an
    address and/or a structure with a building identification number (BIN), but for
    which there is no tax lot. Pseudo lots may exist for locations with open space,
    subway or train stations, skyways, tunnels, or other miscellaneous features. Note
    that this is not a comprehensive dataset of locations with these types of features.
