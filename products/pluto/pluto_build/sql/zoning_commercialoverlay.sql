-- calculate how much (total area and percentage) of each lot is covered by a commercial overlay
-- assign the commercial overlay(s) to each tax lot
-- the order commercial overlays are assigned is based on which district covers the majority of the lot
-- a district is only assigned if more than 10% of the district covers the lot
-- OR more than a specified area of the lot if covered by the district
