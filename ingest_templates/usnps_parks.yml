  description: >-
    NPS Director's Order #25 states: "Land status maps will be prepared to identify the
    ownership of the lands within the authorized boundaries of the park unit. These
    maps, showing ownership and acreage, are the ''official record'' of the acreage of
    Federal and non-federal lands within the park boundaries. While these maps are the
    official record of the lands and acreage within the unit''s authorized boundaries,
    they are not of survey quality and not intended to be used for survey purposes." As
    such this data is intended for use as a tool for GIS analysis. It is in no way
    intended for engineering or legal purposes. The data accuracy is checked against
    best available sources which may be dated and vary by location. NPS assumes no
    liability for use of this data. The boundary polygons LRD creates represent the
    current legislated boundary of a given NPS unit. NPS does not necessarily have full
    fee ownership or hold another interest (easement, right of way, etc...) in all
    parcels contained within this boundary. Equivalently NPS may own or have an interest
    in parcels outside the legislated boundary of a given unit. In order to obtain
    complete information about current NPS interests both inside and outside the units
    legislated boundary, the tracts file created by LRD should be used in conjunction
    with this boundary file created by LRD.
