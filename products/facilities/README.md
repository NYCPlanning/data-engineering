## Development:
### Configurations
- We strongly advise that you use VScode for development of this project
- The `.devcontainer` contains all development configuration you would need, including:
    - `psql` is preinstalled
    - `python-geosupport` is installed with 21a geosupport
    - `poetry` is installed and initialized
    - `pre-commit` is also preconfigured and no additional setup is needed
- If you do not have vscode setup, don't worry, you can still develop using docker-compose
    - initialize docker-compose: `./facdb.sh init`
    - the facdb.sh script is a one to one wrapper of the python facdb cli, e.g. `./facdb.sh --help`
    - docker-compose is also used to test PR and build the dataset in github actions

### Pipeline development with the `facdb` cli
>ðŸ’¡ Note: the cli documentation might not always be up-to-date, to see the latest commands and features, use `facdb --help`

- Create a pipeline function under the name of the function, e.g. `dcp_colp`
- If you don't want to run every command with `poetry run`, we recommend you activate the virtual environment by `poetry shell`
- `facdb --help` to show instructions
```console
foo@bar:~$ facdb --help
Usage: facdb [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  build        Building facdb based on facdb_base
  clear        clear will clear the cached dataset created while reading a...
  dataloading  Load SQL dump datasets from data library e.g.

```
<details><summary>Examples</summary>
    
- `facdb init` initialization of the database with `facdb_base`, functions and stored procedures
- `facdb dataloading` load supplementry datasets from data-library (e.g. `dcp_mappluto_wi`, `doitt_buildingcentroids`)
- `facdb run`
    - `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions` to execute both the python and sql part specified in `datasets.yml`
    - `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions --python` to execute the python part only
    - `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions --sql` to execute the sql part only
    - `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions --python --sql` is the same as `facdb run -n nysed_activeinstitutions`
    - `facdb run --all` to run all available data piplines defined in `datasets.yml`
- `facdb sql`
    - `facdb sql -f facdb/sql/dcp_colp.sql` to execute one script
    - `facdb sql -f facdb/sql/dcp_colp.sql -f some/other/script.sql` to execute multiple scripts
- `facdb clear`
    - `facdb clear -n nysed_activeinstitutions` to clear cache for nysed_activeinstitutions
    - `facdb clear --all` to clear all cache for all datasets
- `facdb build` build facdb from loaded source tables and produce QAQC tables

# FacDB Source Data Updates
Like most of our data products, source data must be updated in data library before FacDB is run. As there are are many source datasets with varied update processes, this issue template should be opened to track progress towards updating all source data

**All source data listed is to be uploaded as .csv files**

## Geosupport

## Version Env
- [ ] Update previous version for QCQA in `version.env` file

These don't report date updated as neatly as the open datasets, have to look at data itself

- [ ] fbop_corrections https://www.bop.gov/locations/list.jsp

- [ ] foodbankny_foodbanks http://www.foodbanknyc.org/get-help/
      1. head to http://www.foodbanknyc.org/get-help/
      2. navigate to the map and make a copy of the map
      3. After making a copy, click on the three dots next to the target layer and click "Export Data" and export as a csv
      4. Rename the file (still as a csv) to match Food_Bank_For_NYC_Open_Members_as_of_DATE(YYYYMMDD). You will need to convert the existing date format MMDDYY to YYYYMMDD so that the version matches existing date format standard in data library.
      5. place it at the library/tmp folder
      6. then run library archive --name foodbankny_foodbanks with the -version flag set to the DATE in the file path
    url: "http://www.foodbanknyc.org/get-help/"
    dependents: []

      5. place it at the library/tmp folder

## Last step
- [ ] dcp_pops
Source: Download from POPs app, available on DCP Commons. Be sure to only take the public version.
