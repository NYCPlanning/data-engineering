/*
DESCRIPTION:
    Create initial table of project inputs (groups of record_ids that refer to the
    same project). Match non-DOB records based on spatial overlap,
    forming arrays of individual record_ids which get called
    project_record_ids. Two of the neighborhood study sources are not
    included, as units from these sources do not deduplicate
    with other sources.

INPUTS:
	combined
OUTPUTS:
    _project_record_ids
