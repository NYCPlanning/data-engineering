# CEQR

New York City's Environmental Quality Review (CEQR) process requires the use of various tabular, geospatial, and qualitative data resources from city, state, and federal sources. This CEQR data product is a collection of datasets to help zoning applicants locate the most up to date resources to conduct their environmental reviews.

Each dataset in this CEQR data product falls into one of the following categories:

1. pointing: a link to a webpage
2. pass-through: a dataset that hasn't been transformed
3. pipelined: a dataset that has been transformed
