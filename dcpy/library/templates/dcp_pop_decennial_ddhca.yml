      ## Census Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics-A file from Population
      This file is produced internally by the Population division. It contains data from multiple versions of the 
      Census Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics A (DDHCA) file with updated estimates for the current year.

      It is received via email or file transfer from the DCP Population division

      It is currently meant to be archived in "as_is" format

      Notes:
        - Totally distinct from the related `_dhca` file.
        - "Detailed" refers to "Detailed Race and Ethnicity", e.g. The count of Polish residents of a Census Tract
        - Does not contain CBs, making it (perhaps counterintuitively) much smaller than the non-detailed file
