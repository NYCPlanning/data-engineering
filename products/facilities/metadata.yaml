summary: "The Department of City Planning aggregates information about 30,000+ facilities\
  \ and program sites that are owned, operated, funded, licensed, or certified by\
  \ a City, State, or Federal agency in the City of New York into a central database\
  \ called the City Planning Facilities Database (FacDB). These facilities generally\
  \ help to shape quality of life in the city\u2019s neighborhoods, and this dataset\
  \ is the basis for a series of planning activities. This public data resource allows\
  \ all New Yorkers to understand the breadth of government resources in their neighborhoods.\
  \ The data is also complemented with a <b><a href=\"https://capitalplanning.nyc.gov/facilities\"\
  >new interactive web map</a></b> that enables users to easily filter the data for\
  \ their needs. Users are strongly encouraged to read the database documentation,\
  \ particularly with regard to analytical limitations.\n\nQuestions about this database\
  \ can be directed to <b><a href=\"mailto:dcpopendata@planning.nyc.gov\">dcpopendata@planning.nyc.gov</a></b>\n\
