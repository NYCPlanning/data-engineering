    This dataset includes a list of public open spaces, primarily under the jurisdiction of 
    and/or managed by NYC Parks, as well as the percentage of active and passive recreation 
    in each space. It also includes Schoolyard to Playground (SYPG) sites under the jurisdiction 
    of the NYC Department of Education (DOE), and sites managed in partnership with NYC Parks, 
    such as Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge Park, and Battery Park City, among others.

    Active open space refers to areas used for sports, exercise, or active play, including but 
    not limited to, playgrounds, sports fields, and fitness equipment. Passive open space refers 
    to areas for relaxation, such as sitting, strolling, or picnicking. These areas may include 
    plazas, beaches, walking paths, as well as features that contribute to the overall use of 
    public open spaces, such as bathroom and maintenance structures, parking lots, and cultural 
    institutions. While these latter features are not defined as 'passive' in the 2021 CEQR Open 
    Space chapter, they will be included in the forthcoming updated version of the chapter.

    This dataset is intended for use in completing an Open Space analysis as part of the City 
    Environmental Quality Review (CEQR) process only. 
    
    Please fully read the Data Dictionary linked below before using this dataset to complete 
    a CEQR Open Space analysis. Additional research may be necessary to identify other open space 
    resources within a given study area, including those managed by federal, state, and city 
    agencies, as well as private entities. For more information on the Open Space analysis and 
    lists of passive and active features as defined by CEQR, visit:
