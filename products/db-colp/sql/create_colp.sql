/*
DESCRIPTION:
    1) Cleans relevant columns from DCAS' IPIS.
    2) Merges these records with the results of running input BBLs
        through Geosupport's BL function.
    3) Creates category and expanded category fields for use types

        Categories are:
        -- 1: Everything else
        -- 2: Residential
        -- 3: No current use

        Expanded categories are:
        -- 1: Offices
        -- 2: Educational facilities
        -- 3: Recreational & cultural facilities, cemetaries
        -- 4: Public safety and judicial
        -- 5: Health & social services
        -- 6: Tenented & retail
        -- 7: Transportation & infrastructure
        -- 8: Not in use
        -- 9: In use residential
        -- NULL: Dispositions and other final commitments

    4) Backfills missing community districts by joining with PLUTO on the geosupport-returned
        billing BBL.
