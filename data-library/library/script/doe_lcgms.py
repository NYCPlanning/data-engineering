    NOTE:
    Dec 23, 2022 the ingest() has since being deprecated because the request endpoints and params are not stable.
    New ingest_csv() takes the static csv and created according to the documentation in the yml template is used
    for data library.

    May 6, 2022 The request body for downloading the spreadsheet has not been stable from one year to the next.
    View https://www.nycenet.edu/PublicApps/LCGMS.aspx in developer mode (⌘+⌥+C on mac) (with Chrome in this case).
    Then click " Downloadable School Data in Excel Format".
    Then navigate to the network tab and click on the "LCGMS.aspx" listed in the box titled "Names".
    Then navigate to the payload and click on "view source" to get a single string of
    "_EVENTTARGET" "_EVENTARGUMENT", etc.
    Set the body arg in the python script as this string and then run the ingestion.


    This string was generated by the click and sent as a post request to the aspx server.
    It is probably worth to monitor whether those
    arguments would become stable enough that this manual process won't need to be repeated each time for update.
    Otherwise, alternative manual download the spreadsheet and upload as local file might be preferred to current method.
