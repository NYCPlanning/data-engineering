      ### Building Footprints
      Shapefile of historical footprint outlines of buildings in New York City. 
      Please see the following link for additional documentation- 
      https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md.
      Previously posted versions of the data are retained to comply with Local Law 106 of 2015 and 
      can be provided upon request made to Open Data.
      NOTE: The Socrata UID is not the same as the url (below). We want UID: ipkp-snf6 which is 
      the multipolygon geojson layer. There are two layers of data on the opendata portal:
      one contains the multipolygon (building_historic) and the other contains points only (building_historic_p).
