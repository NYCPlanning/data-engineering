This is the primary repository for the Data Engineering team at the NYC Department of City Planning (DCP).

It is used to build data products for internal and external use. Each product has it's own folder in `products/` where their respective code and READMEs can be found.

The [Data Engineering wiki page](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/data-engineering/wiki) in this repo is the single source of truth for all of our documentation.
