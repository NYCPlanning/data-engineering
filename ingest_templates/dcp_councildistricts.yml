  description: >
    The City Council Districts of New York City clipped to the shoreline at mean high
    tide. The City Council Districts are the result of the recent redistricting process,
    which takes place every ten years to reflect population changes reported in the 2000
    Census. These geographies were redrawn by the New York City Council Redistricting
    Commission.
