DESCRIPTION:
    1. Unpivot sca_e_projections so that we get a table like the following: 

        district |  projected  | school_year |  ps  |  is  
       ----------+-------------+-------------+------+------
        1        | PK          | 2018        |  XXX |  NULL  
        4        | PK          | 2022        |  XXX |  NULL
        ...      | ...         | ...         |  ... |   ...
        5        | 7           | 2023        |  NULL|   XXX
        1        | 8           | 2026        |  NULL|   XXX
        ...      | ...         | ...         |  ... |   ...

    2. FULL OUTER JOIN sca_e_projections and sca_e_pct, so that
    we can calculate subdistrict level "is" and "ps" for each 
    school year by applyiny the multipliers. 
        "is" is defined as grade ('7','8') 
        "ps" is defined as grade ('PK','K','1','2','3','4','5','6')
    
    3. Aggregate over district, subdistrict, school_year by taking
    the ceiling of the sum for "is" and "ps"
