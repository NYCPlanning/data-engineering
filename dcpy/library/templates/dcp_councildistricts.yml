      ### ESRI Shapefile
      The City Council Districts of New York City clipped to the shoreline at mean high
      tide. The City Council Districts are the result of the recent redistricting process, which takes
      place every ten years to reflect population changes reported in the 2000 Census. These
      geographies were redrawn by the New York City Council Redistricting Commission.
