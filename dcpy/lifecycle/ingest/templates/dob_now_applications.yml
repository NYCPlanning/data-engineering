    DOB NOW job applications received from DOB via the DOB FTP which can be accessed via CyberDuck on DCP 
    Windows machines (see internal documentation for credentials). The encoding standard of 
    the file should be double checked before and after uploading to Digital Ocean as it 
    has changed between versions (from "Windows-1252" to "utf-8", etc).
    
    There is an extensive writeup in a github issue about DOB NOW custom job filing data
