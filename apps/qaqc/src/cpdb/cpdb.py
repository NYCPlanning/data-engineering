        ### About the Capital Projects Database

        The Capital Projects Database (CPDB), a data product produced by the New York City (NYC) Department of City Planning (DCP) Data Engineering team, captures key data points on potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects sponsored or managed by a capital agency in and around NYC.
        Information reported in the Capital Commitment Plan published by the NYC Office of Management and Budget (OMB) three times per year is the foundation that CPDB is built from.  Therefore, only capital projects that are in the Capital Commitment Plan are reflected in CPDB. Additional data sources are incorporated to map the capital projects.
        CPDB enables Planners to better understand and communicate New York City's capital project portfolio within and across particular agencies. While not comprehensive, CPDB's spatial data provides a broad understanding of what projects are taking place within a certain area, and is starting point to discovering opportunities for strategic neighborhood planning.

        ### About the QAQC Reports

        The QAQC page is designed to highlight key measures that can indicate potential data issues in a CPDB build. These graphs report summary statistics at the agency level and there are 3 ways to filter and view the data (w/ additional variation at the graph level):

        1. Agency type: Sponsoring agency OR Managing agency
        2. Aggregation type: the total number of projects OR the total sum ($) of all commitments
        3. Category type: Include projects in all categories (fixed asset, lump sum, ITT, Vehicles & equipment) OR include only projects that are categorized as Fixed Asset

        Additionally, there are basic geographic checks to facilitate the QAQC process of the disparate source data we receive from various city agencies. These checks are not meant to be comprehensive, rather they are intended to provide an indication if spatial data is outside of the NYC spatial boundaries or incorrect in some way.

        ### Key CPDB QAQC terms: 

        - **Mapped**: refers to a project record that has a geometry / spatial data associated with it.
        - Agency type: The **Managing** agency is the NYC Agency that is overseeing the construction of a project.  The **Sponsoring** agency is the NYC Agency that is funding the project.  The managing agency and sponsoring agency can be, but are not always the same.
        - Category type: Fixed Assets, are projects that are place specific and have an impact on the surrounding area, visible or not, such as park improvements or sewer reconstruction.  Projects are categorized by DCP based on key works in the project description.  Other categories include Lump Sum, and ITT, Vehicles, and Equipmentâ€‹.
        - A **project** is a discrete capital investment, and is defined as a record that has a unique FMS ID.  
        - A **commitment** is an individual contribution to fund a portion of a project.  When looking at the "commitment" view you're looking at the sum of a commitments.

        Anomalies include, but are not limited to, no projects being mapped for a given agency when there were mapped projects in the previous version, the number of projects doubling for an agency between versions, or the total sum of commitments halving for an agency between versions.
