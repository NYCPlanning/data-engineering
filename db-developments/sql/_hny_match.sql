/*
DESCRIPTION:
    Merging devdb with hny. This requires the following procedure.

    1) Merge hny data from hpd_hny_units_by_building with hny_geocode_results,
        and filter to new construction that isn't confidential. Create a unique ID 
        using a hash.
    2) Find matches between geocoded devdb and hny using three different methods:
        a) JOIN KEY: geo_bin, geo_bbl
        b) JOIN KEY: geo_bbl
        c) SPATIAL JOIN: geom
        For all three, hny.units_total must be within 5 units dev_db.classa_prop.
        The devdb record cannot be a demolition.
    3) Combine unique matched found by the three methods into the table all_matches, 
        assigning priority by match method and development type.
        In cases where a hny record matches with either multiple developments records
        or with a single developments record in multiple ways, matches get assigned 
        based on this hierarchy:
            1: Residential new building matched on both BIN & BBL
            2: Residential new building matched only on BBL
            3: Residential new building matched spatially
            4: Alteration or non-residential non-demolition matched on both BIN & BBL
            5: Alteration or non-residential non-demolition matched only on BBL
            6: Alteration or non-residential non-demolition matched spatially
    4) Create HNY_matches:
        For each hny_id, find the highest-priority match(es). This will either be the best 
        match, or multiple matches at the same priority-level. Add/remove matches using 
        CORR_hny_matches.
    5) Assign flags to indicate one_hny_to_many_dev and/or one_dev_to_many_hny.
    6) Resolve the one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many cases in HNY_matches
        in order to create HNY_lookup
        a) One-to-one matches get assigned directly
        b) For one devdb to many hny, sum the total_units and all_counted_units for all hny rows
        c) For multiple devdb to one hny, assign units to the one with the lowest job_number.
            Remaining matches are retained, but get NULLs in the unit fields.
    7) Merge  devdb with HNY_lookup
        JOIN KEY: job_number
