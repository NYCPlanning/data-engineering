    important natural resources within NYC Parks property. Approximately 12,500
    acres of NYC Parks' 30,000 acres of land is comprised of natural areas -
    forests, salt marshes, open water, grasslands, streams, and freshwater wetlands.
    The vast majority of these natural areas are accessible to residents and visitors.
    These areas provide valuable habitat for wildlife and a variety of environmental
    services to all New Yorkers including carbon sequestration, air quality improvement,
    cooling, and stormwater capture.
