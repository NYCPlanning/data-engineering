The project will also include a greenway along the banks of the restored Brook, connecting to the existing greenway in Van Cortlandt Park and northward to the 750-mile Empire State Trail.   Once completed, the daylighting initiative will remove roughly 4 to 5 million gallons of water from the Bronx sewer system each day, more on rainy days. The resulting additional capacity in the sewer system will help to reduce sewer overflows into the Harlem River and could lessen flooding in some areas of the Broadway corridor, while diverting brook water away from the Wards Island Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility, which reduces treatment costs and greenhouse gas emissions.
