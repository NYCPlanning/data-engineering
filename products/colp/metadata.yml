      on the tax map and in MapPLUTO. It is generally associated with the
      condominium management organization. For air rights lots, the mapped BBL
      is the donating BBL from the Air_Rights_Lot table in the Department of
      Finance’s Digital Tax Map. If there is more than one donating BBL, the one
      whose lot number most closely matches that of the air rights lot is used.
      For all other lots, MAPBBL is the same as BBL.
