  description: |
    The Zoning Tax Lot Database is a comma-separated values (CSV) file format that contains up-to-date zoning by parcel.
    The Database includes the zoning designations and zoning map associated with a specific tax block and lot.
    The Database is updated on a monthly basis to reflect rezoning and corrections to the file.
    The downloadable zoning data will be updated on a monthly basis or as needed.
    Updates will include recent zoning changes adopted by the City Council.
