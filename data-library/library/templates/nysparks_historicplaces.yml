      ## National Register of Historic Places
      The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP) oversees more than 250 state parks, historic sites, recreational trails, golf courses, boat launches and more, encompassing nearly 350,000 acres, that are visited by 74 million people annually. These facilities contribute to the economic vitality and quality of life of local communities and directly support New York’s tourism industry. Parks also provide a place for families and children to be active and exercise, promoting healthy lifestyles. The agency is responsible for the operation and stewardship of the state park system as well as advancing a statewide parks, historic preservation, and open space mission.

      The New York State Historic Preservation Office maintains the list of New York State’s National Register of Historic Places. The National Register of Historic Places is the official list of the Nation's historic places worthy of preservation. Authorized by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 ( Federal Regulation 36 CFR 60 ) the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places is part of a national program to coordinate and support public and private efforts to identify, evaluate, and protect America's historic and archeological resources. To be considered eligible, a building, district, structure or object must meet the National Register Criteria for Evaluation. This involves examining the property’s age, integrity, and significance. Please see metadata for additional information, including how to access the agency’s Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS) which provides access to the agency’s database of historic records associated with each project listing in this dataset.
