There is no routine enforcement of the anti-idling law, and only spotty and largely unsuccessful enforcement of targeted violations. Drivers of commercial and private motor vehicles park at our curbs and run their motors continuously with impunity. The Upper West Side is particularly vulnerable to asthma and other health problems from pollution because of our high population density and the continued use of polluting fossil fuels for heating our buildings. DEP has no funds budgeted for enforcement of the anti-idling law, and similarly neither the NYPD nor Traffic Enforcement engages in routine enforcement nor responds to individual, specific complaints.
