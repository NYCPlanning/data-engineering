  name: Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps 2015
  description: |
    FEMA's Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps (PFIRMs), released in 2015 as part of a citywide flood map update, are the best available flood hazard data for building code and planning purposes. They show areas vulnerable to flooding from 1% annual chance storm, also sometimes called the Special Flood Hazard Area or 100-year floodplain. They also show today's 0.2% annual chance floodplain, also known as the 500-year floodplain.

    V Zone: Areas along coasts subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event with additional hazards associated with storm-induced waves. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) or flood depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and floodplain management standards apply.

    A Zone: Areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and floodplain management standards apply.

    Shaded X Zone: Areas between the limits of the base flood and the 0.2-percent-annual-chance (or 500-year) flood.
