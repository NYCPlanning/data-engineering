      ###  The cbbr_submissions (Community Board Budget Requests) data consists of budget 
      requests submitted through NYC's various community boards. Each record consists of 
      an indiviudal budget request and the responsible agencies response to each formal 
      budget request. This data is compiled by DCP Strategic Planning and given to DCP Data
      Engineering team as an xlsx file which is manually uploaded and ingested via data-library.

      Note:
      In the latest iteration of the .xlsx file we recieved from DCP Strategic Planning,  
      a vlookup function was used to get key value pairs in certain columns which created invalid data
      when saving the file as a csv. 
      To bypass this, the DE member can (in the original source data file):
      1. Select the cell (or column) where the VLOOKUP formula is
      2. Right click and select "Copy"
      3. Select the cell or column with the VLOOKUP and select "Paste Special..."
      4. In the Paste Special Dialog popup, select the "Values" option (the data should now 
      persist without the need for the VLOOKUP)
      5. Delete the "Keys" sheet and save as a cbbr_submissions.csv (the csv file is needed as it's the 
      acceptable tabular format for data-library)
      6. Add the cbbr_submissions.csv to library/tmp/cbbr_submissions.csv path
      7. Test that the file is uploaded correctly and columns populate with valid data
