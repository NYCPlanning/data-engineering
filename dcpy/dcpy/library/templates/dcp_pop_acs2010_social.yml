      ## 2010 ACS file from Population
      This file is produced internally by the Population division. 2010 version is used as a reference dataset
      for the latest ACS data, and occasionally is modified so these different subsections are archived as their
      own recipe datasets so that they can easily be updated individually

      In 2024, this file had to be loaded "as_is". This doesn't load the xlsx from pop due to the way "scriptors" currently work,
      but rather the csv output by the "scriptor". This was needed because the input sheet has over 2000 columns, which seems
      to be a limit for gdal.
