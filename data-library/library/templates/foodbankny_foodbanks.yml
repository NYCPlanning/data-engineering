      ## Update Instructions
      1. head to http://www.foodbanknyc.org/get-help/
      2. navigate to the map and make a copy of the map
      3. After making a copy, click on the three dots next to the target layer 
      and click "Export Data" and export as a csv 
      4. Rename the file (still as a csv) to match Food_Bank_For_NYC_Open_Members_as_of_DATE(YYYYMMDD). You will need to convert the existing date format MMDDYY to YYYYMMDD so that the version matches existing date format standard in data library.
      5. place it at the library/tmp folder 
      6. then run library archive --name foodbankny_foodbanks with the -version flag set to the DATE in the file path
