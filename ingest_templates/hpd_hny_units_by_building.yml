  name: Housing New York Units by Building
  description: |
    The Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) reports on buildings, units, 
    and projects that began after January 1, 2014 and are counted towards the Housing New York plan. 
    The Housing New York Units by Project file presents this data by project, and includes project-level data, 
    such as senior units, but does not include building-level data. 
    The unit counts are provided for each project, rather than by building. 
    For additional documentation, including a data dictionary, review the attachments in the 
    “About this Dataset” section of the Primer landing page.
