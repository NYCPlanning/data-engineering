  name: NYC Stormwater Flood Maps - Limited Flood (1.77 inches/hr) with Current Sea Levels
  description: >-
    To help New Yorkers understand and prepare for this risk, the City has created four
    rainfall-based flooding maps.
    
    The maps show limited stormwater flooding under current sea level rise conditions,
    moderate stormwater flooding scenarios under current and future sea level rise conditions,
    as well as an extreme stormwater flooding scenario under future conditions.
