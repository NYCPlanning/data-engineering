The bridge is currently fully funded with $129M in City capital funds and we advocate for the project?s swift progress, as creating a safe space for pedestrians and cyclist is an urgent concern here.",Street Name: East River Esplanade    Cross Street 1: East 13th Street  Cross Street 2: East 13th Street,,East River Esplanade,East River Esplanade,East 13th Street,East 13th Street,,,,DOT,841,2,This project is in design by EDC.,Manual_Research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

Given the growing congestion of high-speed, east-west vehicular and bicycle traffic, and growing numbers of pedestrians attempting to cross to Wegmans, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and the water ferry, this thoroughfare has become ever more treacherous. It is an accident waiting to happen. The Board requests better signage, lane markings, and haptic enhancements to differentiate the pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular lanes. Supporting safe, multi-modal transit has positive impacts on congestion, the environment, and community health, but many residents are still afraid to leave their private vehicles because our streets are not designed for multi-modal safety.",Street Name: Flushing Ave    Cross Street 1: Navy St  Cross Street 2: Williamsburg St W,,Flushing Ave,Flushing Ave,Navy St,Williamsburg St W,,,,DOT,841,6,This request is not recommended for funding.,Manual_Research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
