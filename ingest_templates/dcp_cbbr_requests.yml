  description: >-
    This data consists of budget requests submitted by NYC's community boards, exported
    from the DCP-maintained web app requests are submitted. Each record consists of  an
    indiviudal budget request and the responsible agencies response to each
    formal  budget request. 

    This data is currently sent to DE by CAPS, although pulling it could be automated.

    It is supplemented by omb_cbbr_agency_responses, linked by UNIQUE_ID to DCPUNIQID.
    We archive both because OMB combines multiple fields relating to location, making
    geocoding more difficult
