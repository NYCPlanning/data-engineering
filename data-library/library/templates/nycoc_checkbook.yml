      The NYC Office of the Comptroller Checkbook dataset was created by EDM DE Fellows in response 
      to a request from Capital Planning to explore the feasibility of creating a data product 
      focused on connecting geospatial data to historical liquidations data to better inform 
      future spending decisions at the community level. 

      The spending data comes from Checkbook NYC and captures all Capital Project 
      spending 2010 - present (data collected May 31, 2023). The geospatial data comes
      from Capital Projects Database, a data product built and maintained by EDM DE.
      Specifically, the geospatial data comes from points and polygons geometries
      for all accepted versions of CPDB 2017-2022, for which the last versions of the
      points and polygons shape files built each year were downloaded from Digital 
      Ocean, and the executive (latest) version of CPDB from 2023.
