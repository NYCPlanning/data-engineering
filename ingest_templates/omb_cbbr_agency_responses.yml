  description: >-
    This data consists of budget requests submitted by NYC's community boards, after
    receiving it back from OMB with responses from relevant agencies

    This data is currently sent to DE by CAPS, unclear how much we could automate it.

    It is essentially based on dcp_cbbr_reqeusts, linked by DCPUNIQID to UNIQUE_ID. We
    archive both because OMB combines multiple fields relating to location, making
    geocoding more difficult
