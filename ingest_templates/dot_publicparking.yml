      Recieved from DOT via email update
            Source data has been sent in two ways:
      * Individual zipped shapefile
      * Part of geodatabase
      If the data is sent via a geodatabse, there are some additional steps
      to load the data into data-library:
      1. Open the geodatabase in a GIS program (QGIS or ArcGIS)
      2. Export individual shapefile following naming convention established in template.yml
       * Make sure to save the file in the proper epsg (2263) which data-library converts to 4326
      3. If not already compressed, compress shapefile, rename following naming convetnions in template
      and move into library/tmp/dot_xxxx.zip
      4. Follow steps to update latest data in data-library
