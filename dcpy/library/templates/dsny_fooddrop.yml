      ### Food Scrap Drop-Off Locations in NYC
      Locations where NYC residents can drop off their food scraps to be composted. Please note that starting on March 20, 2020, DSNY suspended some services to limit person-to-person contact and to enable our workforce to refocus on core operations. Suspended services include Food Scrap Drop-off sites which will be closed until further notice. Residents should not leave food scraps at any location. Visit https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/nyc-food-scrap-drop-off-locations for updates.
