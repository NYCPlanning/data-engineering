      ## NYC Zoning Tax Lot Database
      The Zoning Tax Lot Database is a commaâ€“separated values (CSV) file format that contains up-to-date zoning by parcel.
      The Database includes the zoning designations and zoning map associated with a specific tax block and lot.
      The Database is updated on a monthly basis to reflect rezoning and corrections to the file.
      The downloadable zoning data will be updated on a monthly basis or as needed.
      Updates will include recent zoning changes adopted by the City Council.
