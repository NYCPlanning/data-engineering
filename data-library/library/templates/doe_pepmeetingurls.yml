      The Panel for Educational Policy (PEP) consists of 15 appointed members and the Chancellor.
      Each borough president appoints one member, CEC Presidents elect one member,
      and the mayor appoints the remaining nine members.
      The Chancellor serves as an ex-officio non-voting member.
      The PEP is responsible for electing a chairperson from among the voting members.
