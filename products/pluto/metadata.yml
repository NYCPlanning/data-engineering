      The number of the tax lot.


      This field contains a one to four-digit tax lot number.


      Each tax lot is unique within a tax block (see TAX BLOCK).


      <b>Special handling for condominiums:<b>


      In a condominium complex, each condominium unit is a separate tax lot and has its
      own lot number. In a residential condominium, the condominium units are generally
      the individual apartments; in a commercial condominium, the units might be floors in
      an office building, individual retail shops, or blocks of office space. These unit lot
      numbers have values between 1001 – 6999.


      Each unit tax lot has an associated billing lot number, with values between 7501 –
      7599. Lots in a condominium complex on the same block will have the same billing
      lot number. To make condominium information more compatible with parcel
      information, the Department of City Planning aggregates condominium unit tax lot
      information to the billing lot. For example, if a residential condominium building
      contains 20 units, the Department of Finance will assign 20 unit lot numbers and each
      of these lot numbers will have the same billing lot number. PLUTO will contain one
      record with the billing lot number and RESIDENTIAL UNITS will be set to 20.


      If the Department of Finance has not yet assigned a billing lot number to the
      condominium complex, PLUTO uses the lowest unit lot number within the complex.


      Note on MapPLUTO: The Department of Finance Digital Tax Map (DTM) contains
      the geography of the base lot for condominiums. The base lot is also called the
      “Formerly Known As” or FKA lot. For most condominium complexes, there is one
      base lot per billing lot. In using the DTM to create MapPLUTO, DCP replaces the
      base lot number with the billing lot number. If there is more than one base lot with the
      same billing lot number, DCP merges the base lots to create a geography for the
      billing lot.


      Under certain circumstances, DCP is unable to aggregate condominium unit tax lot
      information to the billing lot or to the lowest unit lot number. This occurs when a
      CONDOMINIUM NUMBER has not yet been assigned to the unit lots in PTS. In
      most cases, these unit lots will appear in PLUTO and in the NOT_MAPPED_LOTS
      table that is released with MapPLUTO. Before including these unit lots, the
      data is checked to verify that it pertains only to the unit lot. If unit lots have an
      identical address and a value for RESIDENTIAL UNITS that is greater than 1 and the
      same for all records, and there is no matching BBL in the DTM, they are assumed to
      part of the same condominium. BUILDING AREA is checked in the same way. These
      unit lots are removed from PLUTO and NOT_MAPPED_LOTS to avoid
      overcounting the number of residential units and building area.

      Health areas were originally created in the 1920s for the purpose of reporting and statistical analysis of public health data. They were based on census tracts and created to be areas of equal population. Health areas are contained within health center districts.

      This field contains a four-digit health area number, which is preceded with leading zeros when the health area is less than four digits. There is an implied decimal point after the first two digits.

      HEALTH AREA contains the value returned by Geosupport for one of the addresses assigned to the lot. If Geosupport does not return a value, HEALTH AREA is calculated spatially using the tax lot’s XY COORDINATES and DCP’s Administrative District Base Map files.

      The zoning district classification of the tax lot. Under the Zoning Resolution, the map of New York City is generally apportioned into three basic zoning district categories: Residence (R), Commercial (C) and Manufacturing (M), which are further divided into a range of individual zoning districts, denoted by different number and letter combinations. In general, the higher the number immediately following the first letter (R, C or M), the higher the density or intensity of land use permitted.

      If the tax lot is divided by a zoning boundary line, ZONING DISTRICT 1 represents the zoning district classification occupying the greatest percentage of the tax lot’s area.

      For example: Tax lot 98 is divided by a zoning boundary line into part A and part B. Part A, the largest portion of the lot, is in a commercial zoning district, while part B is in a residential zoning district. ZONING DISTRICT 1 will contain the commercial zoning district associated with part A.

      Tax lots that intersect with areas designated in NYC Zoning Districts as PARK, BALL FIELD, PLAYGROUND, and PUBLIC SPACE are assigned a single value of PARK in PLUTO. The NYC Zoning Districts do not constitute a definitive list of parks in the city. Lots designated as PARK should not be used to calculate the amount of open space in an area.

      See SPLIT BOUNDARY INDICATOR to determine if the tax lot is divided.

      A code describing the major use of structures on the tax lot.

      Except as described below, BUILDING CLASS is taken from PTS without modification.

      For condominiums, PTS contains the building class for each unit lot. When merging this data into a single record for the billing lot, DCP creates several mixed-use building classes (RC, RD, RI, RM, RX, and RZ). These are assigned as follows:
      • If all unit lots have the same building class, that building class is used for the
      billing lot.
      • PTS building class types are grouped as follows:
        o Commercial - R5, R7, R8, RA, RB, RH, and RK
        o Residential - R1, R2, R3, R4, R6, and RR
        o Mixed commercial and residential – R9
        o Industrial/warehouse - RW
      • If the unit lots are a mixture of commercial building types, BUILDING CLASS = RC.
      • If the unit lots are a mixture of residential building types, BUILDING CLASS = RD.
      • If the unit lots are a mixture of commercial and residential building types, BUILDING CLASS = RM.
      • If the unit lots are a mixture of commercial and industrial/warehouse building types, BUILDING CLASS = RI.
      • If the unit lots are a mixture of commercial, residential, and industrial/warehouse building types, BUILDING CLASS = RX.
      • If the unit lots are a mixture of residential and industrial/warehouse building types, BUILDING CLASS = RZ.
      • When unit lots with a building class of RG (Indoor Parking), RP (Outdoor Parking), RS (Non-Business Storage Space), or RT (Terraces/Gardens/Cabanas) have the same billing lot as another building class, their building class is ignored. For example, if the billing lot has unit lots with a building class of R4 (Residential Unit in Elevator Bldg) and RG (Indoor Parking), BUILDING CLASS = R4.

      Q0 is assigned by DCP to tax lots with a PTS building class starting with “V” that are identified in the NYC GIS Zoning Database as PARK, BALL FIELD, PLAYGROUND, or PUBLIC SPACE.

      QG is assigned by DCP to tax lots with a PTS building class starting with “V” that contain community gardens from the Department of Parks and Recreation’s NYC Greenthumb Community Gardens dataset. This is done to comply with Local Law 46 of 2020, which requires that such lots be given a land use category of open space, outdoor recreation, a community garden, or other similar description. Lots with a BUILDING CLASS of QG are assigned to LAND USE CATEGORY “09” (Open Space & Outdoor Recreation). This land use assignment is solely informational and does not confer or change a legal status for such a tax lot.

      PTS contains two building classes for some tax lots, with one of the building classes being Z7 (Easement). BUILDING CLASS is only set to Z7 when it is the only PTS building class for the tax lot.

      If the tax lot is not in COLP, PTS is checked to see if the lot’s EXEMPT TOTAL VALUE equals its ASSESSED TOTAL VALUE. If the two values are the same, the lot is given a code of X. Otherwise the tax lot is not given any TYPE OF OWNERSHIP CODE.

      OWNER NAME should be referenced to verify type of ownership, particularly when it’s important to distinguish between state, federal, and public authority ownership.

      The total gross area in square feet, except for condominium measurements which come from the Condo Declaration and are net square footage not gross.

      TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA is populated in the following order of preference:
        1. Gross floor area from PTS
        2. Gross floor area from CAMA
        3. Calculated from the PTS building dimensions and number of stories for the primary building on the lot. TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA calculated by this method will not include floor area for any other buildings on the lot.
        4. TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA is set to zero if the building class starts with “V” and the number of buildings is zero.

      See TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA SOURCE CODE to determine which method was used.

      If TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA SOURCE CODE has a value of 2 (PTS) or 7 (CAMA), the TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA is based on gross building area, also known as total gross square feet. For these data sources, the TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA is for all of the structures on the tax lot, including stairwells, halls, elevator shafts, attics and extensions such as attached garages. Measurements are based on exterior dimensions and take into account setbacks.

      If the TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA SOURCE CODE field has a value of 5, the floor area was calculated from the DOF Property Tax System (PTS) using the building dimensions and number of stories for ONLY the largest structure on the tax lot.

      In all cases, this is a rough estimate of the gross building floor area and does not necessarily take into account all the criteria for calculating floor area as defined in section 12-10 of the Zoning Resolution.

      Roof areas used for parking/garden/playground are not included in the floor area.

      If TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA SOURCE CODE is 2, TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA contains the common area for condominiums.

      If FLOOR AREA, TOTAL BUILDING SOURCE CODE is 7, TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA does not include below grade finished basements.

      If the basement in a one, two or three family structure is above grade and finished, its square footage is included in TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA.

      A TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA of zero can mean it is either not available or not applicable. If NUMBER OF BUILDINGS is greater than zero, then a TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA of zero means it is not available. If NUMBER OF BUILDINGS is zero, then a TOTAL BUILDING FLOOR AREA of zero means it is not applicable.

      The assessed land value for the tax lot.

      The Department of Finance calculates the assessed value by multiplying the tax lot’s estimated full market land value, determined as if vacant and unimproved, by a uniform percentage for the property’s tax class.

      Assessed and exempt values are updated twice a year. Tentative values are released in mid-January and final values are released around May 25. If the date on source file (PTS), as reported in the Readme file, is between January 15 and May 25, ASSESSED LAND VALUE is from the tentative roll for the tax year starting in July.

      The assessed total value for the tax lot.

      The Department of Finance (DOF) calculates the assessed value by multiplying the tax lot’s estimated full market value by a uniform percentage for the property’s tax class.

      DOF values properties based on current and constructive use, rather than legal use. The predominant active use, which determines the classification of a property, is determined by square footage. If the second story of a three-story building is mixed-use, an interior inspection may be necessary to establish the commercial percentage of that story before reclassification. In other cases, a two-story building with retail on the first floor may have a sign identifying a second story accounting office.  If, for example, the second story is a primary residence and there is a difference in square footage from the first to second floor, the mere presence of a business sign does not confirm a predominant commercial use.

      Additional research is required to ensure proper classification.  This can include an internal inspection, speaking to someone at the location or a neighbor, and researching various records (such as filed Real Property Income and Expenses statements) from DOF or other city agencies.

      NYC Property Tax Classes are determined by NYS and described under Real Property Tax Law (RPTL) [Article §18-02](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nysenate.gov%2Flegislation%2Flaws%2FRPT%2F1802&data=05%7C01%7CLSeirup%40planning.nyc.gov%7Cd62da5a4813248adc71e08dab374460e%7C32f56fc75f814e22a95b15da66513bef%7C0%7C0%7C638019609211103424%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=rr4wH48ewePfrBbuHeY18ewwelGkQVsF62Rs9tJbBj8%3D&reserved=0) which mentions primary use for real property classification.

      Property value is assessed as of January 5th.  If a new building is not completed by April 14th, the assessed building value is 0 and the Building Class reverts to Vacant.

      Assessed and exempt values are updated twice a year. Tentative values are released in mid-January and final values are released around May 25. If the date on source file (PTS), as reported in the Readme file, is between January 15 and May 25, ASSESSED TOTAL VALUE is from the tentative roll for the tax year starting in July.

      For R2X, R3, R4, and C3 zoning districts, ResidFAR does not include the attic allowance, under which the FAR may be increased by up to 20% for the inclusion of space beneath a pitched roof.

      Users should consult Section 24-11 of the Zoning Resolution for more information.

      Because the Digital Tax Map (DTM) and the Property Tax System (PTS) are not updated at the same time, they are slightly out-of-sync. There will be lots in PTS that are not in the DTM and vice versa. In addition, some lots are wholly underwater and are not included in the version of MapPLUTO that is clipped to the shoreline.

      The lot geographies in MapPLUTO (with water areas included) are created from the DTM. City Planning modifies the DTM for condominium lots to show the billing tax lot in MapPLUTO, rather than the base tax lot. If there is more than one base tax lot with the same billing lot, the base tax lots are merged into a single feature and assigned to the billing lot. See LOT for more information on condominium lots.

      MapPLUTO (clipped to shoreline) is created by clipping the full MapPLUTO using DOF’s Shoreline File.
