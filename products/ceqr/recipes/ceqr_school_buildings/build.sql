DESCRIPTION:
   1. Load sca_bluebook and lcgms data, filtering out non-CEQR schools
   2. Round enrollment fields to integers
   3. Create geometry from lcgms coordinates
   4. Combine input data
   5. Output records in lcgms but not in bluebook to csv for research
   6. Output records in both sources to PSTDIN for transfer to EDM database
