-- calculate how much (total area and percentage) of each lot is covered by a special purpose district
-- assign the special purpose district(s) to each tax lot
-- the order special purpose districts are assigned is based on which district covers the majority of the lot
-- a district is only assigned if more than 10% of the lot is covered by the district
-- OR if no lot meets the 10% threshold, than the lot with the highest percentage of the special district is assigned it
