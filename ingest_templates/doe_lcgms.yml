  description: >-
    School-based information can change throughout the year. Each report reflects
    information that is accurate as of the day it is run. Updates for the next school
    year are integrated into the report by July 15 of each year. For additional
    information, contact OOD@schools.nyc.gov.

    Must be manually downloaded from link in `url` field, though attempts to automate
    are welcome.

    An apparently flaky script to grab it automatically can be found here:
