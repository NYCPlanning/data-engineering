  description: >-
    The Traffic Data Viewer (TDV) is an interactive map that allows users to access traffic 
    data information. Using the TDV, the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) and additional 
    traffic statistics for a Traffic Station can be obtained. The data is downloadable for offline 
    usage. The TDV data set is maintained by the Traffic Monitoring Section. A subset of 
    data is available on the popup when clicking a Traffic Station point location. Additional 
    data is available through the Site Dashboard and Site Data Links on the popup. 
    
    The Route Network layer provides a visual representation of Traffic Station segments. 
    The Traffic Station location points provide details for individual counts at the specific 
    location of data collection.
