DESCRIPTION:
    1. Standardize and concatenate the three sources of capacity project data
    2. Assign capital plan year based on data source
    3. Parse school name to determine the organization level
    4. Using the org_level, estimate the proporiton of capacity in each level
    5. Output the full source table to a csv for easy geocoding
