-- calculate how much (total area and percentage) of each lot is covered by a zoning district
-- assign the zoning district(s) to each tax lot
-- the order zoning districts are assigned is based on which district covers the majority of the lot
-- a district is only assigned if more than 10% of the district covers the lot
-- OR the majority of the district is within the lot
-- split and process by borough to improve processing time
-- join each of the boro tables into one table
-- update each of zoning district fields
-- only say that a lot is within a zoning district if
-- more than 10% of the lot is coverd by the zoning district
-- or more than a specified area is covered by the district
