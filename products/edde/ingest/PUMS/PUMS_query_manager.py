This class is responsible for generating list of variables and associated URLs for a 
given set of variable types. 

Use https://data.census.gov/mdat/#/search?ds=ACSPUMS5Y2019 as a reference.
That website provides an interface to construct a query and then see the url to 
access that query via an input.
