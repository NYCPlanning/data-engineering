    The Walk to a Park initiative focuses on increasing access to parks and open 
    spaces, concentrating on areas of the city that are under-resourced and where 
    residents are living further than a walk to a park. NYC Parks calculates the 
    number of New Yorkers within walking distance of a park and reports on this as 
    part of the Mayor’s Management Report. “Walking distance” is defined as a 1/4-mile 
    or less for sites such as small playgrounds and sitting areas; or a 1/2-mile or 
    less for larger parks that serve a wider region, typically over 8 acres or situated on 
    the waterfront. Certain properties in NYC Parks' portfolio, such as cemeteries, 
    community gardens, or sites with no recreational equipment were not included in 
    this analysis. Similarly, some parks and open-space amenities not under the 
    jurisdiction of NYC Parks were included in this analysis, as they provide 
    recreational value. 

    This dataset includes two ESRI shapefiles of access points, one for sites that get 
    a 1/4-mile buffer and one for sites that get a 1/2-mile buffer. This polygon represents 
    the total area within walking distance of a park. To generate the number of 
    New Yorkers within that distance, the polygon is compared with data from the 
    U.S. Census.
