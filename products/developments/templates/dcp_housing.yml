      # DCP Housing Database
      The NYC Department of City Planning’s (DCP) Housing Database Project-Level Files contain 
      all NYC Department of Buildings (DOB)-approved housing construction and demolition jobs 
      filed or completed in NYC since January 1, 2010. It includes all three construction job
      types that add or remove residential units: new buildings, major alterations, and demolitions,
      and can be used to determine the change in legal housing units across time and space. 
      Records in the Housing Database Project-Level Files are geocoded to the greatest level of 
      precision possible, subject to numerous quality assurance and control checks, recoded 
      for usability, and joined to other housing data sources relevant to city planners and analysts.
      Data are updated semiannually, at the end of the second and fourth quarters of each year.
      Please see DCP’s Info Brief summarizing findings from the 20Q2 data release here. 
      Additional Housing and Economic analyses are also available.
      Additional documentation is available on the GitHub Wiki for this project.
