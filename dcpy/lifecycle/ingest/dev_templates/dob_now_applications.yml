    description: |
      DOB NOW job applications received from DOB via the DOB FTP which can be accessed via CyberDuck on DCP 
      Windows machines (see internal documentation for credentials). The encoding standard of 
      the file should be double checked before and after uploading to Digital Ocean as it 
      has changed between versions (from "Windows-1252" to "utf-8", etc).

      There is an extensive writeup in a github issue about DOB NOW custome job filing data
      https://github.com/NYCPlanning/db-developments/issues/386#issue-864138806

      INSTRUCTION FOR DATA UPDATE:
      Must be run with -v flag e.g. library archive -n dob_now_applications -v 20220118
      Since the versioning of this file is based on the date received from DOB so the default version
      given by runtime date won't work.
