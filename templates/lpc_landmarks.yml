  name: Landmarks Preservation Commission - Individual Landmarks
  description: |
    Provides information on all items designated or under consideration for designation
    (i.e. calendared) by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC).

    The dataset contains records for each individual, scenic, or interior landmark, as well as 
    properties or sites located within the boundaries of historic districts. 

    Please note that points in this dataset represent individual buildings in addition to 
    non-building sites (such as vacant lots or monuments) regulated by LPC. It is possible 
    for a single property to have multiple designations (such as individual and interior 
    designations, or individual and historic district). For this reason, it is not uncommon 
    to see multiple points on a single tax lot and multiple records for a single property within 
    the database.
