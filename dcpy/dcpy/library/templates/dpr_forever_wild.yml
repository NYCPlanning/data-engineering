      The Forever Wild layer delineates the location of ecologically important natural resources within NYC Parks property. 
      Approximately 12,500 acres of NYC Parks' 30,000 acres of land is comprised of natural areas - 
      forests, salt marshes, open water, grasslands, streams, and freshwater wetlands. 
      The vast majority of these natural areas are accessible to residents and visitors. 
      These areas provide valuable habitat for wildlife and a variety of environmental services to all New Yorkers 
      including carbon sequestration, air quality improvement, cooling, and stormwater capture.
