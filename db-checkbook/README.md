# Checkbook NYC Exploratory Work and Join to CPDB

## To do:
- upload relevant Checkbook NYC data to Digital Ocean
- write the code to pull down data from Digital Ocean
- Dea and Ali make their own branches and start working on smallest units of extractable code from our original notebooks, checking it into our projects, implementing, then submitting PR
- mimic utility of methods from db-facilities/facdb/cli.py (init, dataloading, build, etc) using facdb terminology
- make a data product-level requirements doc if needed, and update top-level requirements doc (requirements.in) in monorepo with python modules that are generally applicable to the team's work

## Eventually to do: 
- (eventually) add recipe for updating Checkbook NYC data from website
