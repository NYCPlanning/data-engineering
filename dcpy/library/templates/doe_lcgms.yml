      ### LCGMS - New York City district and charter school information
      ### file format & naming
      the downloadable is xls workbook which Data Library does not work with
      needs to manually open it in Excel then save as a csv utf-8 encoding in library/tmp folder 
      before uploading.
      the default naming of the file includes hour and minute timestamp which needs
      to be removed to keep better consistency with our other datasets. The version for the csv should 
      contain the year, month and day like other dataset e.g. LCGMS_SchoolData_20221215.csv
      #### The spreadsheet includes:
      - school names
      - addresses
      - phone numbers
      - principal and superintendent names
      - Field Support Centers’ addresses and phone numbers
      #### Updates
      School-based information can change throughout the year. Each report reflects information that is accurate as of the day it is run.
      Updates for the next school year are integrated into the report by July 15 of each year.
      #### Questions?
      For additional information, contact OOD@schools.nyc.gov.
      ### How to run
      Follow directions in associated python script
      If that doesn't work, convert the downloaded file to a .csv manually and update process to ingest from the csv
